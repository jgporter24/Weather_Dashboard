# Weather_Dashboard
Find your forcast

## Description

This weather dashboard allows for a user to search a city and view the current weather for that city. The search history for the city will be tracked for the user to refer back to if they want to view multiple cities. The user would simply click on one of the cities they have searched and it will populate that weather. The forcast will provide a 3 hour increment forcast due to API restrictions.
